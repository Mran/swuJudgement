swuJudgement requires the following to run (of course the release require nothing):

It's very simple to use . Open it and get everything.

In addition to the last item is a `良`,the rest are `优`.
If you want to make some change , help yourself to download the code and change
the choices,but I strongly recommend that you don't do that because we write directly the
choices in the code(not in a config file).

### <span id = "contributing">Contributing</span>
Please be free to contribute to swuJudgement ,
clone this repo locally and
commit your code on a separate branch.

I strongly hope you can add the feature that people could make their own choices
in the judgement.

swuJudgement is licensed under the GPL license.
